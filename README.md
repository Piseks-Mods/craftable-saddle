# Pisek's Craftable Saddle

After having troubles finding saddle for my piggie "ÄŒesnek" ("Garlic" for you, english speakers), I got another great *(not true)*. In this data pack/mod I added a crafting recipe for Saddles. Playing vanilla, possibility to found saddle is pretty small (as for me), with mods its opposite thanks to lot of structures. This recipe could be harder - using Rabbit Hide instead of Leather but mostly the saddle is brown, not beige *(or whatever the color)*.
